// *Comments for structure and organization
// Game consists of players, two "tokens", rows and columns. I need to...

// 1. Establish variables and Set up a 6 row - 7 collumn board
// 2. Fill the board with empty characters
// 3. Create a game loop
// 4. Show Board
// 5. Ask Player for move then try
// 6. If it works -> check for winner -> if there is a winner end game, record score, switch players.
